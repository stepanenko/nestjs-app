## Project structure
When you run nest new, Nest generates a boilerplate application structure by creating a new folder and populating an initial set of files.
You can continue working in this default structure, adding new components, as described throughout this documentation.
We refer to the project structure generated by nest new as standard mode. Nest also supports an alternate structure for managing multiple projects
and libraries called monorepo mode.

Aside from a few specific considerations around how the build process works (essentially, monorepo mode simplifies build complexities
that can sometimes arise from monorepo-style project structures), and built-in library support, the rest of the Nest features,
and this documentation, apply equally to both standard and monorepo mode project structures. In fact, you can easily switch from
standard mode to monorepo mode at any time in the future, so you can safely defer this decision while you're still learning about Nest.
